**If you found this library, don't use it in production. It is under heavy development. I don't know what I am doing. I am basically learning C++ and how to connect Node and C++ together.**

# OpenCV NodeJS

Node bindings for OpenCV. Currently, only tested on Mac.

## Dependencies

In order to make this library work you have to install OpenCV on your machine. I highly recommend to just use `brew`. Otherwise, you can look [here and follow official installation instructions](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+install+opencv).

```
brew install opencv
```

All you have to do after that is to install this library with `yarn` or `npm`.

```
yarn add opencv-nodejs
```
